The front end of the L-Night project

This is the L-Night project I created as my final project at WBS Coding school.

For this full-stack app I used the following stack:

For the front-end: 

ReactJS and MUI, for the email contact form Nodemailer integrated with Gmail and recapctha for the contact form.
For the Calendar I used React Calendar, the events are stored at the moment in MongoDB but eventually the events would come from the
Facebook page of the L-Night group. This would happen after the app has been in review by FB as the API is very restricted for security reasons.

For the backend I used Express, MongoDB and for the gallery pictures AWS S3 bucket.
For the authentication which is only for admins I used JWT.

I will extend this project and add a merchandise store which I would create using Shopify and possibly Printify.
