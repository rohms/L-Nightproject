                <p>The L-Night Berlin group was founded in April 2013. The original organizers have changed but the group is going strong. We could safely say that L-Night is one of the most regular meetings for English speaking queer women in Berlin. Lesbian visibility is important and that is also why this group is so precious in many ways and in bringing people together almost for a decade!</p>
                <p>L-night Berlin group is a friendly, (mainly) English-language social group for queer women and non-binary individuals who feel they have a connection to the women's community. We particularly welcome women who are marginalised within the LGBTQIA+ community, such as trans women, women of colour, older women, disabled women and other similar groups.</p>
                <h3>When do we meet?</h3>
                <p>We meet mostly every Tuesday at 8pm and occasionally on weekends for special events/clubs.
                We have had also our first official L-Night party event couple years ago and have bigger plans ahead!</p>
                <h3>What kind of events do we have?</h3>
                <p>Venues change week to week as we explore queer/alternative spaces stretching from Prenzlauer Berg to Neuk√∂lln and beyond. Past events include park outings, BBQs, club nights, Christmas markets and many other events. We have many favourite bars but new suggestions are always welcome.</p>
                <p>L-night has expanded steadily since its creation in April 2013. We have in Facebook and Meetup around 3,000 members. Our weekly meetings are always on (virtually when needed) and always growing with new members and venue locations. If you're looking to expand your circle of friends or enjoy a drink or trip to the park with like-minded people, join us on Tuesday!</p>
                <p><b>With warm regards,<br/>
                The L-Night admin team</b></p>
